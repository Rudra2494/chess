# JavaScript Chess Game

This project is an implementation of a classic chess game in JavaScript, designed to run in a web browser. It allows two players to play a game of chess against each other.

## Features

- **Traditional Chess Rules**: Follows standard chess rules including castling, en passant, pawn promotion, etc.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for players to make moves by clicking on pieces.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Alternates turns between two players until checkmate, stalemate, or draw conditions are met.
- **Basic AI Opponent**: Implements a basic AI opponent for single-player mode.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for game logic and behavior.
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides structure and styling for the game interface.

## Getting Started

To run the chess game locally:
1. **Open `Chess.html` in a web browser**:
   - Double-click on `Chess.html` to open it in your default web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can serve it using a local server if you have one set up.

   - The game should load in your browser. You can now start playing chess!
   - Follow on-screen instructions for gameplay controls (clicking pieces to move, etc.).

   - Now type in the code **Python flask_app.py** in there. **Note** do not copy paste it.
